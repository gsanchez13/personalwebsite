      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

            And now, an excerpt from one of my favorite novels. The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho.

            "When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you achieve it."

            There are so many moments in life where we hold so much doubt, in ourselves, in the people around us or situations presented to us. Many of these moments pass us by and one of the most poisoning feelings that remain is regret. Our destiny will always lead us to the path we are meant to take, but we can also play a role by choosing our destiny.
